TO SYDNEY ROGERS, A PLAYMATE OF MINE.


MY DEAR SYD.,

If you laugh heartily at the Pictures in this Book, I shall not have
laboured in vain: if you feel glad that the Rhymes are as you and I
remember them, and recognise the few old ones, now printed for the first
time, it will add to the satisfaction I shall feel.

When you have looked well at the other Cuts, please not to forget the
little children at the corners of the pages, they represent all the
different sorts of boys and girls that I could easily call to mind.

And, with love to all at home,

            Believe me to be,
                    My dear little Boy,
                            Your affectionate friend,

                                                       CHARLES H. BENNETT.

    A cat came fiddling out of a barn,
    With a pair of bag-pipes under her arm;
    She could sing nothing but fiddle cum fee,
    The mouse has married the humble-bee;
    Pipe, cat,—dance, mouse,
    We’ll have a wedding at our good house.

[Illustration]




    As I went through the garden gap,
    Who should I meet but Dick Red-cap!
    A stick in his hand, a stone in his throat,
    If you’ll tell me this riddle, I’ll give you a groat.

                                              [_A cherry._]

    As I was going to St. Ives,
    I met a man with seven wives;
    Every wife had seven sacks,
    Every sack had seven cats,
    Every cat had seven kits:
    Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
    How many were there going to St. Ives?




    As round as an apple, as deep as a cup,
      And all the king’s horses can’t pull it up.

                                        [_A well._]




    A diller, a dollar,
    A ten o’clock scholar,
    What makes you come so soon?
    You used to come at ten o’clock,
    But now you come at noon.




    A, B, C, tumble down D,
    The cat’s in the cupboard and can’t see me.




[Illustration]

    A farmer came trotting upon his grey mare,
          Bumpety, bumpety, bump.
    With his daughter behind him, so rosy and fair,
          Lumpety, lumpety, lump.
    A raven cried croak! and they all tumbled down,
          Bumpety, bumpety, bump.
    The mare broke her knees, and the farmer his crown,
          Lumpety, lumpety, lump.
    The mischievous raven flew laughing away,
          Bumpety, bumpety, bump.
    And vowed he would serve him the same next day,
          Lumpety, lumpety, lump.




[Illustration]

    A long-tailed pig, or a short-tailed pig,
      Or a pig without a tail;
    A sow pig, or a boar pig,
      Or a pig with a curly tail.




    Abbace,
    Daffagee,
    Kellamenoppekew,
    Rustyvee,
    Doubleyou,
    X, Y, Z.




    All of a row,
      Bend the bow,
    Shot at a pigeon,
      And killed a crow.




    A, B, C, and D, pray, playmates agree,
    E, F, and G, well so it shall be.
    J, K, and L, in peace we will dwell.
    M, N, and O, to play let us go.
    P, Q, R, and S, love may we possess.
    W, X, and Y, will not quarrel or die.
    Z, and ampherse-and, go to school at command.




    Bell horses, bell horses, what time of day?
    One o’clock, two o’clock, off and away.




    Barber, barber, shave a pig;
    How many hairs will make a wig?
    “Four and twenty, that’s enough.”
    Give the poor barber a pinch of snuff.

[Illustration]




    Blow, wind, blow! and go, mill, go!
    That the miller may grind his corn;
    That the baker may take it,
    And into rolls make it,
    And send us some hot in the morn.




[Illustration]

    Bah, bah, black sheep, have you any wool,
    Yes, marry have I, three bags full:
    One for my master, and one for my dame,
    But none for the little boy who cries in the lane.




    Brow, brow, brinkie;
    Eye, eye, winkie;
    Nose, nose, nopper;
    Mouth, mouth, merry;
    Cheek, cheek, cherry;
    Chin, chin, chopper.




    Bye, baby, bunting,
    Daddy’s gone a hunting,
    To get a little rabbit skin
    To wrap his baby bunting in.




    Cross patch, draw the latch,
      Sit by the fire and spin;
    Take a cup, and drink it up,
      Then call your neighbours in.




    Cry, baby, cry,
    Put your finger in your eye,
    And tell your mother it wasn’t I.

[Illustration]




    Cock a doodle doo!
      My dame has lost her shoe;
    My master’s lost his fiddle stick,
      And don’t know what to do.




    “Come, let’s to bed,” says Sleepy-head;
      “Tarry a while,” says slow:
    “Put on the pot,” says Greedy-gut,
      “We’ll sup before we go.”

[Illustration]




    Cuckoo, cherry tree,
    Catch a bird and give it to me;
    Catch another
    And give it to brother.




    Cock Robin got up early,
      At the break of day,
    And went to Jenny’s window,
      To sing a roundelay.

    He sang Cock Robin’s love
      To the pretty Jenny Wren,
    And when he got unto the end,
      Then he began again.




    Ding, dong, bell,
    Pussy’s in the well!
    Who put her in?
    Little Tommy Green;
    Who pull’d her out?
    Little Johnny Stout;
    What a naughty boy was that
    To try and drown poor pussy cat,
    Who never did him any harm,
    But kill’d the mice in his father’s barn.

[Illustration]




    Dickery, dickery, dare,
    The pig flew up in the air;
    The man in brown
    Soon brought him down,
    Dickery, dickery, dare.




    Danty, baby, diddy,
    What can mammy do wid’e?
        Sit in a lap,
        And give it some pap,
    Danty, baby, diddy.




    Deedle, deedle, dumpling, my son John
    Went to bed with his stockings on;
    One shoe off, the other shoe on,
    Deedle, deedle, dumpling, my son John.




    Daffy-down-dilly has come up to town,
    In a fine petticoat and a green gown.

[Illustration]




    Diddlety, diddlety, dumpty,
      The cat ran up the plum tree;
    Half-a-crown, to fetch her down,
      Diddlety, diddlety, dumpty.




    Ding, dong, darrow,
    The cat and the sparrow;
    The little dog has burnt his tail,
    And he shall be hang’d to-morrow.




    Eggs, butter, cheese, bread,
    Stick, stock, stone, dead,
    Stick him up, stick him down,
    Stick him in the old man’s crown.




    Elizabeth, Lizzy, and Betsy and Bess,
    They all went together to seek a bird’s nest.
    They found a bird’s nest with five eggs in,
    They all took one and left four in.




    Een-a, deen-a,
    Dine-a, dust,
    Catt’ll-a, ween-a,
    Wine-a, wust,
    Spit, spot, must be done,
    Twiddlum, twaddlum, twenty-one.
    O-U-T, spells out,
    A nasty dirty dish-clout.

[Illustration]




    F for fig, J for jig,
      And N for knuckle bones,
    I for John the waterman,
      And S for sack of stones.




    Flour of England, fruit of Spain,
    Met together in a shower of rain;
    Put in a bag tied round with a string,
    If you’ll tell me this riddle, I’ll give you a ring.

                                       [_A plum pudding._]




[Illustration]

    Four and twenty tailors, went to kill a snail,
    The best man among them durst not touch her tail.
    She put out her horns, like a little Kyloe cow;
    Run, tailors, run, or she’ll kill you all just now.




    Girls and boys, come out to play,
    The moon doth shine as bright as day;
    Come with a whoop, come with a call,
    Come with a good-will or not at all.
    Up the ladder and down the wall,
    A halfpenny roll will serve us all.
    You find milk, and I’ll find flour,
    And we’ll have a pudding in half an hour.




[Illustration]

    Great A, little a,
      Bouncing B!
    The cat’s in the cupboard,
      And can’t see me.




    Hickety, pickety, my black hen,
    She lays eggs for gentlemen;
      Sometimes nine,
      Sometimes ten.
    Gentlemen come every day,
    To see what my black hen doth lay.




    Here we are on Tom Tiddler’s ground,
    Picking up gold and silver.




    Here comes a poor woman from baby-land,
    With three small children in her hand:
    One can brew, the other can bake,
    The other can make a lily-white cake.
    One can sit in the garden and spin,
    Another can make a fine bed for the king;
    Pray ma’am will you take one in?




[Illustration]

    Hey! diddle diddle,
    The cat and the fiddle,
    The cow jump’d over the moon;
      The little dog laugh’d
      To see such sport,
    While the dish ran after the spoon.




    Hicky more, hacky more,
    Hung at the kitchen door,
        All day long,
      Nothing so long,
      Nothing so strong,
    As hickeymore, hackymore,
    Hung at the kitchen door
        All day long.

                  [_Sunshine._]




    Hickory, diccory dock,
    The mouse ran up the clock,
      The clock struck one,
      And down the mouse run,
    Hiccory, diccory, dock.




[Illustration]

    Hark, hark,
        The dogs do bark,
        The beggars are coming to town;
    Some in rags, and some in jags,
        And some in velvet gowns.




[Illustration]

    Humpty Dumpty, sat on a wall;
    Humpty Dumpty had a great fall;
    Not all the king’s horses, nor all the king’s men
    Could set Humpty Dumpty up again.




    Here we go round the mulberry bush,
        Mulberry bush,
        Mulberry bush,
    Here we go round the mulberry bush,
        On a cold frosty morning.

    This is the way we brush our hair,
        Brush our hair,
        Brush our hair,
    This is the way we brush our hair,
        On a cold frosty morning.

[_Followed by_ “This is the way we clean our boots,” _etc._]




    Hey ding a ding, what shall I sing?
    How many holes in a skimmer?
    Four and twenty—my stomach’s empty;
    Pray, Mamma, give me some dinner.




    Here we go up, up, up,
      And here we go down, down, downy;
    Here we go backwards and forwards,
      And here we go round, round, roundy.

    Hush-a-bye, baby, on the tree top,
    When the wind blows the cradle will rock;
    When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall,
    Down comes hush-a-bye, baby, and all.




    I had a little pony,
      His name was Dapple-gray,
    I lent him to a lady,
      To ride a mile away;
    She whipped him, she slashed him,
      She rode him through the mire;
    I would not lend my pony now
      For all the lady’s hire.




    I lost my little mare in Lincoln-lane,
      And could’nt tell where to find her,
    Till she came home both lame and blind,
      With never a tail behind her.




[Illustration]

    I had a little doll, the prettiest ever seen,
    She washed up the dishes, and kept the house clean.
    She went to the mill, to fetch me some flour,
    And always got it home, in less than an hour.
    She baked me my bread, she brewed me my ale,
    She sat by the fire, and told me a tale.




    If all the world were apple pie,
    And all the sea was ink,
    And all the trees were bread and cheese,
    What should we have for drink?




    I’ll tell you a story,
    About Jack a Nory,
    And now my story’s begun:
    I’ll tell you another,
    About Jack and his brother,
    And now my story’s done.




    I had a little husband,
      No bigger than my thumb,
    I put him in a pint pot,
      And there I bid him drum.

    I bought a little horse,
      That gallop’d up and down;
    I bridled him and saddled him,
      And sent him out of town.

    I gave him some garters,
      To garter up his hose,
    And a little pocket-handkerchief,
      To wipe his pretty nose.

    Jack and Jill went up the hill,
    To fetch a pail of water;
    Jack fell down, and broke his crown,
    And Jill came tumbling after.




    Jack Sprat could eat no fat,
    His wife could eat no lean;
    And so betwixt them both,
    They lick’d the platter clean.

    Kiss me asleep, and kiss me awake,

    Little Bo-peep has lost her sheep,
      And can’t tell where to find them;
    Leave them alone, and they’ll come home,
      Dragging their tails behind them.

    Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,
      And dreamt she heard them bleating;
    But when she awoke, she found it a joke,
      For they were still fleeting.

    Then up she took her little crook,
      Determined for to find them;
    She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
      For they’d left all their tails behind ’em.

    Little boy blue, come blow up your horn,
    The sheep’s in the meadow, the cow’s in the corn.
    Where is the little boy, minding the sheep?
    Under the haycock fast asleep!

[Illustration]




    Little Robin Red-breast sat upon a tree,
    Up went Pussy-cat, and down went he;
    Down came Pussy-cat, and away Robin ran;
    Says little Robin Red-breast, “Catch me if you can.”

    Little Robin Red-breast jumped upon a spade,
    Pussy-cat jumped after him, and made him afraid;
    Little Robin chirp’d and sung, and what did Pussy say?
    Pussy-cat said “Mew, mew, mew,” and Robin flew away.




    Little Anne Etticoat,
    In a white petticoat,
    And a red nose;
    The longer she stands,
    The shorter she grows.

    Little Tee Wee,
    He went to sea,
    In an open boat;
    And while afloat
    The little boat bended,
    And my story’s ended.




    Little Mary Ester,
    Sat upon a tester,
    Eating of curds and whey;
      There came a large spider,
      And sat down beside her,
    And frighten’d poor Mary away.




    Little Jack Horner sat in the corner,
      Eating a Christmas pie:
    He put in his thumb, and pull’d out a plum,
      And said “What a good boy am I!”

    Lady-Bird, Lady-Bird
      Fly away home,
    Your house is on fire,
      Your children at home.




    Little Robin Red-breast
      Sat upon a rail:
    Niddle noddle went his head,
      And waggle went his tail.




[Illustration]

    Little Tommy Tucker,
    Sang for his supper;
    What shall he eat?
    White bread and butter.
    How shall he cut it
    Without e’er a knife?
    How will he marry
    Without e’er a wife?




    Master I have, and I am his man,
    Gallop a dreary dun;
    Master I have, and I am his man,
    And I’ll get a wife as fast as I can;
    With a heighly gaily gamberally,
      Higgledy piggledy, niggledy, niggledy,
      Gallop a dreary dun.




    My story’s ended,
    My spoon’s bended;
    If you don’t like it,
    Go to the next door,
    And get it mended.

    Mary, Mary, quite contrary,
      How does your garden grow?
    With silver bells and cockle-shells,

    Margery Mutton-pie and Johnny Bo-peep,
    They met together in Gracechurch Street,
    In and out, in and out, over the way,
    Oh! says Johnny, ’tis chop-nose day.




    Multiplication is vexation,
      Division is as bad;
    The Rule of Three it puzzles me,
      And Practice drives me mad.




    My mother and your mother
      Went over the way;
    Said my mother to your mother,
      It’s chop-a-nose day.

    Oranges and lemons,
    Said the Bells of St. Clement’s.

    You owe me five farthings,
    Said the Bells of St. Martin’s.

    When will you pay me?
    Said the Bells of Old Bailey.

    When I grow rich,
    Said the Bells of Shoreditch.

    When will that be?
    Said the Bells of Stepney.

    I do not know,
    Said the great Bell of Bow.

    Here comes a candle to light you to bed,

      One misty, moisty morning,
      When cloudy was the weather,
    I chanced to meet an old man clothed all in leather,
    He began to compliment, and I began to grin,
      How do you do? and how do you do?
      And how do you do again?




    Old Mother Goose, when
    She wanted to wander,
    Would ride through the air
    On a very fine gander.

[Illustration]

    Mother Goose had a house,
    ’Twas built in a wood,
    Where an owl at the door
    For sentinel stood.

[Illustration]

    This is her son Jack,
    A plain-looking lad,
    He is not very good,
    Nor yet very bad.

    She sent him to market,
    A live goose he bought,
    Here, mother, says he,
    It will not go for nought.

[Illustration]

    Jack’s goose and her gander
    Grew very fond;
    They’d both eat together,
    Or swim in one pond.

[Illustration]

    Jack found one morning,
    As I have been told,
    His goose had laid him
    An egg of pure gold.

[Illustration]

    Jack rode to his mother,
    The news for to tell,
    She call’d him a good boy,
    And said it was well.

    Jack sold his gold egg
    To a rogue of a Jew,
    Who cheated him out of
    The half of his due.

[Illustration]

    Then Jack went a courting
    A lady so gay,
    As fair as the lily,
    And sweet as the May.

[Illustration]

    The old Mother Goose
    That instant came in,
    And turned her son Jack
    Into famed Harlequin.

[Illustration]

    She then touched her wand,
    Touch’d the lady so fine,
    And turn’d her at once
    Into sweet Columbine.

[Illustration]

    Jack’s mother came in,
    And caught the goose soon
    And mounting its back
    Flew up to the moon.

    Old mother Twitchet had but one eye,
    And a long tail which she let fly;
    And every time she went over a gap,
    She left a bit of her tail in a trap.

    There was a man in double deed,
    Who sow’d his garden full of seed;
    And when the seed began to grow,
    ’Twas like a garden full of snow;
    And when the snow began to fall,
    ’Twas like a bird upon the wall;
    And when the bird away did fly,
    ’Twas like an eagle in the sky;
    And when the sky began to roar,
    ’Twas like a lion at the door;
    And when the door began to crack,
    ’Twas like a stick across your back;
    And when your back began to smart,
    ’Twas like a penknife in your heart;
    And when your heart began to bleed,
    You’re dead, and dead, and dead, indeed.

    There came by a pedlar whose name was Stout,
    He cut her petticoats all round about;
    He cut her petticoats up to the knees,
    Which made the old woman to shiver and freeze.

    Home went the little woman all in the dark,
    Up got the little dog, and he began to bark;
    He began to bark, so she began to cry,

    O dearest Jenny Wren!
      If you will but be mine,
    You shall feed on cherry-pie, you shall,
      And drink new currant-wine;
    I’ll dress you like a goldfinch,

    So, dearest Jen, if you’ll be mine,
      Let us appoint the day.

    Jenny blush’d behind her fan,
      And thus declared her mind;
    Since, dearest Bob, I love you well,
      I’ll take your offer kind;
    Cherry-pie is very nice,
      And so is currant-wine;
    But I must wear my plain brown gown,
      And never go too fine.

    Robin Redbreast rose up early,
      All at the break of day,
    And he flew to Jenny Wren’s house,
      And sung a roundelay;
    He sang of Robin Redbreast,
      And little Jenny Wren,
    And when he came unto the end,
      He then began again.




[Illustration]

    Jenny Wren fell sick
      Upon a merry time;
    In came Robin Redbreast,
      And brought her sops and wine.

    Eat well of the sop, Jenny,
      Drink well of the wine;
    Thank you, Robin, kindly,
      You shall be mine.

    Jenny, she got well,
      And stood upon her feet,
    And told Robin plainly,
      She loved him not a bit.

    Robin being angry,
      Hopp’d upon a twig;
    Saying, Out upon you, Jenny!
      Fy upon you, bold faced jig!




    To market, to market, to buy a fat pig,
    Home again, home again, dancing a jig;
    Ride to the market to buy a fat hog,
    Home again, home again, jiggety-jog.




[Illustration]

    Tell tale, tit!
    Your tongue shall be slit,
    And all the dogs in the town
    Shall have a little bit.




    Two little dicky birds sat upon a hill,
    One nam’d Jack, the other named Jill;
    Fly away, Jack! fly away, Jill!
    Come again, Jack! come again, Jill!




    Three children sliding on the ice
      Upon a summer’s day,
    As it fell out, they all fell in,
      The rest they ran away.

    Now had these children been at home,
      Or sliding on dry ground,
    Ten thousand pounds to one penny
      They had not all been drown’d.

    You parents all that children have,
      And you that have got none,
    If you would have them safe abroad,
      keep them safe at home.




    Thirty days hath September,
    April, June, and November:
    February has twenty-eight alone,
    All the rest have thirty-one,
    Excepting leap-year, that’s the time
    When February’s days are twenty-nine.




        There was a little man
        And he woo’d a little maid,
    And he said, “Little maid, will you wed, wed, wed?
        I have little more to say,
        Than will you, Yea or Nay,
    For least said is soonest mended-ded, ded, ded.”




    The art of good driving’s a paradox quite,
      Though custom has proved it so long;
    If you go to the left, you’re sure to go right,
      If you go to the right, you go wrong.




    Twelve huntsmen with horns and hounds,
    Hunting over other men’s grounds!
    Eleven ships sailing o’er the main,
    Some bound for France and some for Spain:
    I wish them all safe home again:
    Ten comets in the sky,
    Some low and some high;
    Nine peacocks in the air,
    I wonder how they all came there,
    I do not know and I do not care;
    Eight joiners in joiner’s hall,
    Working with the tools and all;
    Seven lobsters in a dish,
    As fresh as any heart could wish;
    Six beetles against the wall,
    Close by an old woman’s apple stall;
    Five puppies of our dog “Ball,”
    Who daily for their breakfast call;
    Four horses stuck in a bog,
    Three monkeys tied to a clog;
    Two pudding-ends would choke a dog,
    With a gaping, wide-mouthed, waddling frog.




    There was a man, and his name was Dob,
    And he had a wife, and her name was Mob,
    And he had a dog, and he called it Cob,
    And she had a cat, called Chitterabob.
                      Cob, says Dob,
                      Chitterabob, says Mob,
                      Cob was Dob’s dog,
                      Chitterabob Mob’s cat.




    Up she goes and down she comes,
    If you haven’t got apples, I’ll give you some plums.

    Upon my word and honour,
    As I was going to Bonner,
    I met a pig,
    Without a wig,
    Upon my word and honour.




    Vinegar, veal, and venison,
    Are very good victuals, I vow.




    When a Twister a twisting, will twist him a twist;
    For the twisting of his twist, he three times doth intwist;
    But if one of the twines of the twist do untwist,
    The twine that untwisteth, untwisteth the twist.

    Untwirling the twine that untwisteth between,
    He twirls, with the twister, the two in a twine:
    Then twice having twisted the twines of the twine,
    He twisteth the twine he had twined in twain.

    The twain that, in twining, before in the twine,
    As twines were intwisted; he now doth untwine:
    ’Twixt the twain inter-twisting a twine more between
    He, twirling his twister, makes a twist of the twine.




      We’re all in the dumps,
      For diamonds are trumps;
    The kittens are gone to St. Paul’s!
      The babies are bit,
      The moon’s in a fit,
    And the houses are built without walls.

    When good king Arthur ruled this land,
      He was a goodly king;
    He stole three pecks of barley-meal,
      To make a bag-pudding.

    A bag pudding the king did make,
      And stuff’d it well with plums:
    And in it put great lumps of fat,
      As big as my two thumbs,

    The king and queen did eat thereof,
      And noblemen beside;
    And what they could not eat that night,
      The queen next morning fried.




    What are little boys made of, made of,
    What are little boys made of?
    Snaps and snails, and puppy-dog’s tails;
    And that’s what little boys are made of, made of.

    What are little girls made of, made of, made of,
    What are little girls made of?
    Sugar and spice, and all things that are nice;
    And that’s what little girls are made of, made of.




    What shoe-maker makes shoes without leather,
    With all the four elements put together?
      Fire and water, earth and air;
      Ev’ry customer has two pair.

    Wash, hands, wash,
      Daddy’s gone to plough,
    If you want your hands wash’d,
      Have them wash’d now.




    Wash on Friday,
    Wash in need;
    Wash on Saturday,
    Slut indeed.

    When I was a bachelor, I lived all by myself,
    And all the bread and cheese I got I put upon the shelf.
    The rats and the mice they made such a strife,
    I was forced to go to London to buy me a wife.
    The roads were so bad, and the lanes were so narrow,
    I was forced to bring my wife home in a wheel-barrow.
    The wheel-barrow broke, and my wife had a fall,
    Down came wheel-barrow, wife, and all.




    You shall have an apple,
      You shall have a plum,
    You shall have a rattle-basket,
      When your dad comes home.




    X shall stand for playmates Ten;
    V for Five stout stalwart men;
    I for but One, as I’m alive;
    C for a Hundred, and D for Five;
    M for a Thousand soldiers true;
    And all these figures I’ve told to you.




    Yet didn’t you see, yet didn’t you see,
        What naughty tricks they put upon me?
    They broke my pitcher, and spilt my water;
    And huff’d my mother, and chid her daughter;
        And kissed my sister instead of me.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that:

• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
